# lyst-ios-coding-standards

This repository will become our central point of reference for all and any coding standards, styling, design patterns and anything else we decide to adhere to as a team in order to produce better code.

This will be a set of small, straightforward, and living documents. In short, read and absorb, but also challenge and update.

In the spirit of openness, and of sharing knowledge (something that is engendered in so much of the iOS community already), we have decided to make this open source. You are welcome to fork it for your own uses, and even submit pull requests if you would like to contribute back.
