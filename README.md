# lyst-ios-coding-standards

This repository will become our central point of reference for all and any coding standards, styling, design patterns and anything else we decide to adhere to as a team in order to produce better code.

This will be a set of small, straightforward, and living documents. 

In short, read and absorb, but also challenge and update.
